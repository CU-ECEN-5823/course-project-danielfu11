The device (subsystem) that I am developing is the friend node in our bluetooth mesh network. It is a wearable glove meant to be used by the person controlling the view of health diagnostics (doctor or coach). The glove has 5 flex sensors attached along each finger, which are used by the user in various different gestures (finger motions) that translate to different user commands. The Friend Node will then collect the data from the specified node and shows it on the LCD display. Other gestures can be implemented to provide additional functionality. An accelerometer will be used to wake up the device from sleep to save power when not in use
